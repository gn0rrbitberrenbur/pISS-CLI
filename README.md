# pISS-CLI
stream the levels of the iss urinetank right in your terminal

## dependencies
you need the [lightstreamer client sdk](https://sdk.lightstreamer.com/ls-python-client/2.1.0/api/intro.html). install it by running the following:
```
pip install lightstreamer-client-lib
```

## why???
I got inspired by seeing [this project](https://github.com/Jaennaet/pISSStream) and wanted to do something similar. I just think its funny that we're able to get such mundane information like the levels of the iss-urinetank. maybe just don't question it too much as I just had fun messing around with nasas lighstreamer server.
